#  Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset (Iris Dataset)


## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to **explore and visualize the Iris dataset** to understand data patterns, distributions, and relationships between features.  
This task helps develop fundamental data analysis and visualization skills using Python.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Iris Dataset  
- **Source:** Built-in dataset available in `seaborn`  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers belonging to three species:
  - *setosa*  
  - *versicolor*  
  - *virginica*  
  Each sample includes four numeric features:
  - sepal_length  
  - sepal_width  
  - petal_length  
  - petal_width

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python 3  
- pandas  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧩 Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading:** Loaded the Iris dataset using seaborn.  
2. **Data Inspection:** Checked dataset shape, column names, and types.  
3. **Summary Statistics:** Used `.describe()` and `.info()` for data overview.  
4. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Scatter plot (sepal_length vs sepal_width)  
   - Histograms for feature distributions  
   - Box plots to identify outliers  
5. **Insights:** Derived key observations from visual patterns.

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Scatter Plot:** Showed clear distinction among species.  
- **Histograms:** Revealed distribution of numerical features.  
- **Box Plots:** Highlighted potential outliers and spread of values.

## 💡 Key Insights
- The dataset has 150 entries and 5 columns.  
- Petal measurements provide the clearest separation between species.  
- Few outliers exist in sepal width.  
- The data is clean, balanced, and ideal for beginner-level ML tasks.

## 📈 Outcome
A complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook that provides visual understanding of the Iris dataset.  
This forms a foundation for future machine learning modeling tasks.
